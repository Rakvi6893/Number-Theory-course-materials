I prepared these lecture notes when I taught number theory at University of Pennsylvania during spring 2023. I would like to acknowledge Brett Frankel who generously shared his materials with me when he taught 
this class. I adopted some of his ideas, especially the idea of peer assessment review (PAR). Most of the homework and midterm (1/2/3) problems are from Brett's materials, I made some modifications to that.
You are welcome to use these for your own course, let me know if you have any questions/suggestions/comments on these.
